=============================================================================
::: FROM VERSION V1.0 to V2.0
=============================================================================

1- Major upgrades
  a- FEAST-MPI is now available allowing up to three levels of parallelism (MPI -calling- MPI -calling -OpenMP)
  b- Compilation links (see below)
  c- Definition of "case" while using FEAST_RCI has changed  
    - case 10, FACT of zB-A
    - case 11, SOLVE of (zB-A)*x=work
    - case 20, FACT of (zB-A)^T (* optional if case 21 can be handled by user using FACT of zB-A,
                                 * otherwise the user is responsible to create a new matrix (zB-A)^T and then factorize it)                              
    - case 21, SOLVE of (zB-A)^T*x=work
    
     Also
     -case 30, A*x multiplication from column of going from fpm(24) to fpm(24)+fpm(25)-1 (size fpm(25))
     -case 40, B*x multiplication from column of going from fpm(24) to fpm(24)+fpm(25)-1 (size fpm(25))

  d- Rename of FEAST interfaces (argument list is unchanged):
         v1.0                v2.0
    RCI
       {s,d}feast_rci  ==>  {s,d}feast_srci
       {c,z}feast_rci  ==>  {c,z}feast_hrci
    DENSE     
       {s,d}feast_dst  ==>  {s,d}feast_syev
       {s,d}feast_dge  ==>  {s,d}feast_sygv
       {c,z}feast_dst  ==>  {c,z}feast_heev
       {c,z}feast_dge  ==>  {c,z}feast_hegv
    BANDED     
       {s,d}feast_bst  ==>  {s,d}feast_sbev
       {s,d}feast_bge  ==>  {s,d}feast_sbgv
       {c,z}feast_bst  ==>  {c,z}feast_hbev
       {c,z}feast_bge  ==>  {c,z}feast_hbgv
    SPARSE     
       {s,d}feast_sst  ==>  {s,d}feast_scsrev
       {s,d}feast_sge  ==>  {s,d}feast_scsrgv
       {c,z}feast_sst  ==>  {c,z}feast_hcsrev
       {c,z}feast_sge  ==>  {c,z}feast_hcsrgv


2-Compilation and Linking:
 a- Propose an alternative compilation procedure for fortran 90 users alone who have problems to compile/link 
    with wrappers for C low level functions (within this option the FEAST library is not fortran runtime dependency free): 
    -Option changes included in /src/make.inc
    -Adding /src/f90_functions_wrapper.f90
    -Modification of /src/f90_noruntime_dependency.fi -- "pointer" statement added at the declaration of array variables
 b- MPI compilation added has an option for the FEAST-MPI library
 c- C wrappers to FEAST interfaces have been removed from the /src/ directory and library compilation. C users can found 
    the include files in /include
 d- Compilation links have changed (..Examples..)
    -lfeast                 (basic kernel)
    -lfeast_dense -lfeast   (dense interface- requires basic kernel)
    -lfeast_banded -lfeast  (banded interface- requires basic kernel)
    -lfeast_sparse -lfeast_banded -lfeast  (sparse and banded interfaces- require basic kernel)
     ===>Remarks<===: for FEAST-MPI, "feast" ==> "pfeast"
 e- The sparse interfaces need to be linked with MKL-PARDISO v10.3 (update 5 and beyond) which features the transpose option
    for PARDISO. As a result, the complex Hermitian problem would be solved up to x2 times faster (as compared to v1.0). 

3- FEAST PARAMETERS- Definition of fpm (==feastparam) updated or changes for parameters: 
    - fpm(9) (new for MPI option)  contains the user defined MPI communicators for a given search interval (MPI_COMM_WORLD by default)
    - fpm(10) is removed
    - fpm(11) is removed  ==> simplify transpose option in the RCI calls
    - fpm(14) is added ==>  possibilty to return only subspace Q size M0 after 1 contour  

4- Other Technicalities
   a- Replace "*feastparam[64]" by "*feastparam" in the C wrappers (bug fixed)
   b- Modification of lbprim --return to line with "& statement" may cause problem to some Fortran compilers at runtime.
   c- Remove wread_line subroutine (unused)
   e- if #max loop is reached, the info code =2 but eigenvalues/vectors and residuals are still computed.
   f- #maxloop can now be set to 0, if a single contour is desired (without outer-iteration loop)
   g- For information (consultation) only, all the eigenvalues in the subspace are returned (not only the ones contained in the search interval). 
      Similarly, the residuals for the all vector subspace are computed (if option is selected). 
   h- Adding dummy assumed array pointer shape as input for some "lsprim" routines used by the feast_sparse driver (even if those array pointers are unused, 
      some recent Fortran compilers may create error at runtime)<<<<< that was causing feast_sparse to crash using some f90 compilers.
   i- feast_rci.f90 renamed feast.f90
   j- Names of the drivers in /examples have changed (consistent with feast routines)
   k- New Fortran-MPI and C-MPI directories added for /examples and /utility. The corresponding /examples also include a new
    "3pdriver_zfeast_heev" driver which enables 3 levels parallelism (including one for the search interval using MPI)  
    only fpm(9) needs to be defined appropriately
   l- New (additional) function "feastinit_driver(feastparam,N)" which allows to define arbitrary number of parameters for the driver interface from 65 to N
    - feast_sparse would include here the iparm array for pardiso (see documentation for examples)
